HackerBot
=========
HackerBot is a 3D printer with multi-head: up to three FDM extruders and up two other tools like mini-drills, UV curing light, etc.

We used all our experience to achieve a versatile, robust and accurate machine.

When possible we have avoided to design custom parts for facilitating their availability and possible modification.

The project is very scalable. You can start with the basic frame and then add parts and upgrades later.

The HackerBot is an opensource 3D Printer under CC-SA-BY license.

Sending pull requests
---------------------

Please create all pull requests against the [devel branch](https://github.com/OSHW/HackerBot/tree/devel) of HackerBot, as that one is used for developing new 
features and then merged against master when those features are deemed mature enough for general consumption. In case
of bug fixes we'll take care to cherry pick them against master if the bugs they are fixing are critical.
